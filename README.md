# Booking Site using SASS and Flex 💻🌐

Welcome to my repository for the Booking Site project! This project was created as part of my studies in the Advance CSS course on Udemy, and it serves as a repository for the site I built during the course.

## Purpose 🎯

This project is a booking site for travel accommodations built with SASS and Flexbox. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface for users to book their travel accommodations.

## Technology 🔧

The site is built using HTML, CSS, with a heavy emphasis on SASS and Flexbox. SASS is used to make the styling process more efficient and organized, while Flexbox is used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Some of the key technologies and tools used in this project include:

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub

## Features 🚀

- Users can search for accommodations, flights, and rental cars using a simple and intuitive interface
- Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format, with options to filter and sort by price, location, and other criteria
- Users can create an account and save their booking information for future use
- The site is fully responsive and can be accessed on any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones
- The code is well-organized and easy to read, making it easy for developers to maintain and update the site

## Future Plans 🌟

In the future, we plan to add more features to the site, such as the ability to book vacation packages and purchase tickets to local events. We also plan to integrate the site with social media platforms to allow users to share their travel plans with friends and family.
