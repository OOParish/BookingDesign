# Booking Site using SASS and Flex 💻🌐

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this project is to create a booking site that allows users to book accommodations, flights, and rental cars all in one place. The site is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, making the booking process as easy and enjoyable as possible.

## Technology 🔧

The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a heavy emphasis on SASS and Flexbox. SASS is used to make the styling process more efficient and organized, while Flexbox is used to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Features 🚀

- Users can search for accommodations, flights, and rental cars using a simple and intuitive interface
- Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format, with options to filter and sort by price, location, and other criteria
- Users can create an account and save their booking information for future use
- The site is fully responsive and can be accessed on any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones
- The code is well-organized and easy to read, making it easy for developers to maintain and update the site

## Future Plans 🌟

In the future, we plan to add more features to the site, such as the ability to book vacation packages and purchase tickets to local events. We also plan to integrate the site with social media platforms to allow users to share their travel plans with friends and family.
